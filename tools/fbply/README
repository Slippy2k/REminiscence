-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About:
------

fbply is a cutscene player for the game Flashback from Delphine Software. More
informations about the game can found on mobygames [1].

Supported Versions:
-------------------

Currently, only the french PC DOS version has been tested.

Compiling:
----------

Tweak the Makefile if needed and type make (only gcc3 has been tested so far).
The SDL and OpenGL libraries are required.

Running:
--------

You will need the original cutscene files. A cutscene is made of two files :
- *.pol contains the vertices of the primitives (polygons, points, ellipse)
- *.cmd contains some bytecode

To start a video, type something like :
  fbply --datapath=PATH --cutscene=NUM

PATH should point to the directory holding the data files
NUM is the cutscene number (to have the list, run fbply without any arguments)
